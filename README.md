# Python_Challenge
In performing this task I faced several challenges, I hope that the results were as expected according to the task specifications.

Both documents, I relied at first on the class recordings corresponding to the topic I was reviewing, I reviewed my notes to see how far I could go and I resorted to the help of a great friend who guided me and helped me to better understand the topics that I had stuck, thanks to him, I was on track to achieve the results.

Thank you Central Grader
